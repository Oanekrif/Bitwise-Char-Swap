This C program demonstrates how to swap two characters without using a temporary variable. The swap function takes two character pointers and swaps their values using arithmetic operations (+ and -). In the main function, two characters ('h' and 'H') are defined and printed before and after calling the swap function. The output shows that their values are successfully exchanged.
